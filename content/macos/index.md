## Keyboard Shortcuts

What you'll see below is incomplete, for up to date information, check [Apple's documentation](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201236) on keyboard shortcuts. [Dan Rodney's compilation](https://www.danrodney.com/mac/) is a great source as well.

### Finder

|:---:|:---:|
|⌘ ⌫|Send file to trash|
|⌥ ⌘ ⌫|Completely delete a file|
|⌥ ⌘ ⇧ ⌫|Empty the trash|
|⌘ ⇧ N|Create a new folder|
|⌥ ⌘ V|Transfer copied file/folder to the current folder|
|⌘ ⇧ .|Show hidden files/folders|

### Sleep, Restart, Shut Down, Log Out

### Document Editing

These work when editing text using Safari, Notes, and Mail, and any Mac OS application in general. They aren't arbitrary, they're the `emacs` hotkeys, and work on many applications, not just ones on Mac OS.

| Shortcut |                     Function                     |
|:--------:|:------------------------------------------------:|

|   ⌃ H    |   Delete the character left of the the cursor    |
|   ⌃ D    |     Delete the character right of the cursor     |
|   ⌃ U    |        Delete all text left of the cursor        |
|   ⌃ K    |       Delete all text right of the cursor        |
|   ⌃ O    |     Add a newline without moving the cursor      |
|   ⌃ T    | Swap the characters left and right of the cursor |

### Cursor Movement

If you're ever stuck without arrow keys (it could happen!) you can take advantage of these 4 shortcuts.

| Shortcut |   Function    |
|:--------:|:-------------:|
|   ⌃ F    | Move cursor → |
|   ⌃ B    | Move cursor ← |
|   ⌃ P    | Move cursor ↑ |
|   ⌃ N    | Move cursor ↓ |

{{% aside info %}}

**Tip:** These look arbitrary, but they use a helpful pneumonic, hidden as it may be. Forward, Backward, Previous, Next.

{{% aside info %}}

**Tip:** You can add the control `⌃` character to your usual screenshot command, to have screenshots save directly to your clipboard.

{{% /aside %}}

#### Screenshot directly from terminal

There's a hidden terminal command `screencapture` that you can use to capture a screenshot of your current window.

* Capture the screen, save to `example.png`

    ```shell script
    screencapture 'example.png'
    ```

* Capture the screen, save to the clipboard

    ```shell script
    screencapture -c
    ```

* Capture the screen, disable the "click" sound effect

    ```shell script
    screencapture -x 'example.png'
    ```

* Capture the screen, (but after 10 second delay)

    ```shell script
    screencapture -T 10 'example.png' &
    ```

#### Start screen recording from the terminal

You can even use `screencapture` to record video. The `-V` flag specifies to capture a video and the `-A` flag specifies to capture audio as well.

* Record the screen for 10 seconds

    ```shell script
    screencapture -V 10 'example.mp4' &
    ```

{{% aside info %}}

This is mostly just for fun, it's not as practical as the other ways to go about
doing the same thing. If you don't want to use the terminal, you can press
<kbd>⌘ ⇧ 5</kbd> which will give you a host of options to choose from. This is a
new feature in OS X Mojave.

{{% /aside %}}

### Change default screenshot location

I like to put my screenshots in the `~/Downloads` directory. Luckily there's a terminal command for that.

* Set the directory of all future screenshots.

    ```shell script
    defaults write com.apple.screencapture location ~/Downloads && killall SystemUIServer
    ```

### Change default screenshot filetype

By default, screenshots save as PNG files, but you can change this

* Change default screenshot filetype from PNG to JPG

    ```shell script
    defaults write com.apple.screencapture type -string 'jpg' && killall SystemUIServer
    ```

{{% aside danger %}}

**Warning:** Changing the filetype of screenshots to JPG causes some problems with screenshots of an application window. The image will have a jet black background color, instead of the usual transparent white background with a subtle [drop shadow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/filter-function/drop-shadow)

{{% /aside %}}

* Change the screen capture filename to `screenshot`

    ```shell script
    defaults write com.apple.screencapture name -string 'screenshot' && killall SystemUIServer
    ```

## Audio

### Custom Sound Effects

The default system alert sounds are located in `/System/Library/Sounds`, and you
can place your own custom alert sounds in the `~/Library/Sounds` directory. Your
custom alert sound must be an AIFF file (e.g. `example.aiff`).

* Use [ffmpeg](/ffmpeg) to convert an `.mp3` to `.aiff`

    ```shell script
    ffmpeg -i './input.mp3' "${HOME}/Library/Sounds/custom.aiff"
    ```

## Move cursor with the mouse in terminal

This is a cool trick I just discovered. Start typing out a command on the terminal, and then hold ⌥

Now try clicking on a different part of the command you're entering. It will move the cursor to that location!

## Update Software in the Terminal

You can actually update the software on your computer directly from the terminal.

* List available software updates

    ```shell script
    softwareupdate -l
    ```

* The `-l` flag is the *list* option

* Install all updates

    ```shell script
    # Short form
    sudo softwareupdate -iaR
  
    # Long form
    sudo softwareupdate --install --all --restart
    ```

    * The `-i` flag is the *install* option
    * The `-a` flag is the *all* option
    * The `-r` flag is the *restart* option, so the computer will restart and install the updates after they are downloaded

## Fonts

* The default terminal font, **SF Mono**, is by default hidden from the Font Book, and is available exclusively for use in the terminal app. To copy SF Mono to your computer's **Font Book**, run this command.

    ```shell script
    cp -R /System/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app/Contents/Resources/Fonts/* /Library/Fonts
    ```

## Disable User Photo

* Although the GUI doesn't give us an option to disable user-pictures, you can do it with the terminal commands below.

    ```shell script
    # Delete the image chosen during OS installation
    sudo dscl . delete /Users/${USER} Picture

    # Delete an image chosen by the user later on
    sudo dscl . delete /Users/${USER} JPEGPhoto
    ```

## Setting Keyboard Shortcuts from Terminal

Store your keyboard shortcuts in the directory `~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict`. Note that you have to first create `~/Library/KeyBindings` since it won't exist at first.

* `@` : ⌘
* `^` : ⌃
* `~` : ⌥
* `$` : ⇧

* `←` : `\U2190`
* `↑` : `\U2191`
* `→` : `\U2192`
* `↓` : `\U2193`

{{% aside warning %}}

**Note:** Any shortcuts you make using this method will not appear in the
keyboard shortcut settings page in your computer.

{{% /aside %}}

## Fix Permissions

If you mess up your `/etc` files, like I did when I accidentally made every file executable, you can run this command to reset all of the permissions.

* Reset system file permissions to default

    ```shell script
    diskutil resetUserPermissions / $(id -u)
    ```

If you mess up your `/etc/sudoers` file, you'll have to boot into single-user mode with `⌘ S` during power on. From there, you can enter the following commands.

* Reset sudoers file

    ```shell script
    mount -uw /
    chown root:wheel /etc/sudoers
    chmod 440 /etc/sudoers
    reboot
    reboot
    ```


## Customize Launch Application for File Extension

The property list file that controls which app launches for a particular filetype is located deep in Launch Services.

* Open the Launch Services properties list file

    ```shell script
    open file:///Users/${USER}/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices/com.apple.launchservices.secure.plist
    ```

## Default Application

You can install the command `duti` on homebrew to configure the default application that opens when you click on a file with a particular file extension. I've included an example below:

* Setting default application used for `.c` files.

    ```shell script
    # Set apple as the default editor for .c files
    duti -s com.apple.Xcode public.c editor
    # Check the current handlers performed by a UTI
    duti -l com.apple.Safari
    # Describe information about the default app for extension `mp4`
    duti -x mp4
    duti -x mp4
    ```



## Convert SVG to PNG

{{% aside info %}}

**Update:** Since the time I wrote this a couple years back, I've experimented
with a lot of different commands to get this process done right. I'm going to
leave the commands using `qlmanage` and `magick` but personally I don't
recommend them (anymore).

{{% /aside %}}

Install `librsvg`, which is built by GNOME

If you want to convert `example.svg` into a 1024x1024 PNG file, you have a few
choices. These are ordered from **best** to **worst**.

* Using `librsvg`:

    ```shell script
    # If necessary
    brew install librsvg

    rsvg-convert -w 4096 -h 4096 example.svg -o example.png
    ```

* Using [magick resize][ImageMagick's `-resize` option]

    ```shell script
    # If necessary
    brew install imagemagick

    magick convert \
        -resize '1024x1024' \
        -background 'none' \
        'input.svg' 'output.png'
    ```

* Using `qlmanage`, the built-in command-line utility for QuickLook:


    ```shell script
    qlmanage -ts 1024 -o . example.svg
    ```


## `avconvert`

I'm going to write some notes about conversions between audio and video file
formats here. Some useful commands will appear below, but first I want to give a
breakdown of the ecosystem around audio, video, and image file formats.

First, the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) is a group formed by ISO and IEC
to standardize the way audio and visual data is compressed and transmitted
across the internet. MPEG-4 is a method of defining compression of audio and
visual (AV) digital data. It was introduced in late 1998 and designated a
standard for a group of audio and video coding formats and related technology
agreed upon by the ISO/IEC Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG). It was
introduced in late 1998 and designated a standard for a group of audio and video
coding formats and related technology agreed upon by the ISO/IEC Moving Picture
Experts Group (MPEG)

* Encode MOV file `video.mov` as an H.265 (HEVC) encoded 1080p M4V file `video.m4v`

    * Preserving the original video resolution

        ```shell script
        avconvert -p 'PresetHEVCHighestQuality' -s 'video.mov' -o 'video.mp4'
        ```

    * With 1080p resolution

        ```shell script
        # You can add the '-q' flag to suppress output
        avconvert -p 'PresetHEVC1920x1080' -s 'video.mov' -o 'video.m4v'
        ```

### Convert MP3 to M4A

* Convert `song.mp3` into an AAC encoded M4A audio file `song.m4a`

    ```shell script
    # -v is for "verbose"
    avconvert -v -p PresetAppleM4A -s ~/Desktop/song.mp3 -o ~/Desktop/song.m4a
    ```

## `networksetup`

The `networksetup` command allows you to configure your System Preference's *Network* settings directly from your terminal.

* Get the current DNS servers

    ```shell script
    networksetup -getdnsservers Wi-Fi
    ```

* Configure the DNS servers

    ```shell script
    networksetup -setdnsservers Wi-Fi 1.1.1.1 1.0.0.1 2606:4700:4700::1111 2606:4700:4700::1001
    ```

* Get the local machine's MAC address

    ```shell script
    networksetup -getmacaddress Wi-Fi | awk '{print $3}'
    ```

* Configure the SOCKS proxy

    ```shell script
    ssh -fNCD 3339 bastion@remote.site
    networksetup -setsocksfirewallproxy Wi-Fi 127.0.0.1 3339
    networksetup -setsocksfirewallproxy Wi-Fi 127.0.0.1 3339
    ```

* Enable the SOCKS proxy

    ```shell script
    networksetup -setsocksfirewallproxystate Wi-Fi on
    ```

* Disable the SOCKS proxy

    ```shell script
    networksetup -setsocksfirewallproxystate Wi-Fi off
    ```

* List preferred wireless networks

    ```shell script
    networksetup -listpreferredwirelessnetworks en0
    ```

* Remove a preferred wireless network

    ```shell script
    networksetup -removepreferredwirelessnetwork en0 <network>
    ```

* Connect to a WiFi Network

    ```shell script
    networksetup -setairportnetwork en0 <WiFi name> <password>
    ```

* List order of network devices used to connect to the internet

    ```shell script
    networksetup -listnetworkserviceorder
    ```

* Check if Wi-Fi is currently enabled

    ```shell script
    networksetup -getnetworkserviceenabled Wi-Fi
    ```

* Get the name of the current network an interface is connected to

    ```shell script
    networksetup -getairportnetwork en0
    ```

* Print detailed information about the current network connection

    ```shell script
    networksetup -getinfo Wi-Fi
    ```

    ```txt
    # dhcp configuration
    # IP address: 10.26.206.163
    # Subnet mask: 255.255.0.0
    # Router: 10.26.0.1
    # Client ID:
    # IPv6: Automatic
    # IPv6 IP address: none
    # IPv6 Router: none
    # Wi-Fi ID: 6c:96:cf:dc:e5:cb
    # Wi-Fi ID: 6c:96:cf:dc:e5:cb
    ```

## `airport`

There is a hidden command, called airport. 

* Adding the `airport` command to the `${PATH}`

    ```shell script
    file=/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport
    >> ~/.zshrc < =(<<<"path+=(${file})")
    ```

* Scan available WiFi networks

    ```shell script
    airport -s
    ```

* Disconnect from the current WiFi network

    ```shell script
    airport -z
    ```

## `scutil`

* Get the computer's name

    ```shell script
    scutil --get ComputerName
    ```

* Set the computer's name

    ```shell script
    scutil --set ComputerName "Tommy's MacBook Pro"
    ```

* Get the host name

    ```shell script
    scutil --get HostName
    ```

    ```shell script
    scutil --set HostName "nova"
    ```

* Get the localhost name (used for Bonjour)

    ```shell script
    scutil --get LocalHostName
    ```

* Set the localhost name (used for Bonjour)

    ```shell script
    scutil --set LocalHostName "nova"
    ```

## `tmutil`

* If you have a Time Capsule, you can use the `tmutil` utility to interface with Time Machine from your terminal.

* Backups are stored in the following location:

    ```shell script
    tmutil latestbackup
    ```

    ```txt
    /Volumes/Time Machine Backups/Backups.backupdb/My Macbook Pro/2019-08-07-061700
    /Volumes/Time Machine Backups/Backups.backupdb/My Macbook Pro/2019-08-07-061700
    ```

{{% aside warning %}}

**Note:** You have to run all of these as root, so before using `tmutil`, start with `sudo -i`

{{% /aside %}}

* Turn on Time Machine

    ```shell script
    tmutil enable
    ```

* Turn off Time Machine

    ```shell script
    tmutil disable
    ```

* Start backing up to the Time Capsule

    ```shell script
    tmutil startbackup
    ```

* Stop backing up to the Time Capsule

    ```shell script
    tmutil stopbackup
    ```

### Speeding Up Time Machine Backups

If you are having trouble because time machine is taking too long, there's a way to speed up the pace of the back-up.

* Enabling speedy backups (by disabling priority filtering)

    ```shell script
    sudo sysctl debug.lowpri_throttle_enabled=0
    ```

* Disabling speedy backups (by enabling priority filtering)

    ```shell script
    sudo sysctl debug.lowpri_throttle_enabled=1
    ```

The changes made in this command are temporary, they will automatically reset to their default state on their own once the computer has been rebooted.


### Saving Local Snapshots

By default, Time Machine will create *local snapshots*, locally stored backup volumes when it can't connect to your Time Capsule.

* Enable Local Snapshots

    ```shell script
    tmutil disablelocal
    ```

* Disable Local Snapshots

    ```shell script
    tmutil enablelocal
    ```

### Excluding Certain Files & Folders

By default, Time Machine will back up everything on your drive. You may, however, have data from large directories stored elsewhere. If so, it might be a good idea to exclude that directory from Time Machine's backups, in the interest of saving space.

* Exclude files in the directory `~/Downloads` from backups

    ```shell script
    tmutil addexclusion ~/Downloads
    ```

{{% aside warning %}}

**Note:** By default, Time Machine will continue to ignore the files in an excluded directory *even if you move the directory somewhere else*. To have an absolute path excluded instead, use the `-p` flag.

{{% /aside %}}

* Exclude the directory path `~/Downloads` from backups

    ```shell script
    tmutil addexclusion -p ~/Downloads
    ```

* Re-enable backups for the directory (and path) `~/Downloads`

    ```shell script
    tmutil removeexclusion ~/Downloads
    ```

You can also check if a given file, directory, or volume is excluded

* Check if a file is excluded

    ```shell script
    tmutil isexcluded ~/Downloads
    # => [Included] /Users/austin/Downloads
    # => [Included] /Users/austin/Downloads
    ```

* See an exhaustive list of what's being ignored

    ```shell script
    sudo mdfind "com_apple_backup_excludeItem = 'com.apple.backupd'"
    ```

* Restore files to their previous state

    ```shell script
    tmutil restore
    ```

It's pretty hard to reliably exclude things using the native CLI tools. I've heard that [`asimov`](https://github.com/stevegrunwell/asimov) is a great tool to reduce the size of time machine backups.


## Create User from Command Line

Adding a new user to a Mac computer from a Terminal window requires you to define the user’s name, set a password, create the user’s home directory and configure their system permissions.

1. Create a user named `tommy`

    ```shell script
    dscl . create /Users/tommy
    ```

2. Set `tommy`'s shell to `/bin/zsh`

    ```shell script
    dscl . create '/Users/tommy' UserShell '/bin/zsh'
    ```

3. Set Tommy's have the home directory `/Users/tommy`

    ```shell script
    dscl . create '/Users/tommy' NFSHomeDirectory '/Users/tommy'
    createhomedir -u tommy -c
    ```

4. Set tommy's RealName to `Tommy Trojan`

    ```shell script
    dscl . create '/Users/tommy' RealName 'Tommy Trojan'
    ```

5. Give tommy a `UID` number, (for instance, 502)

    ```shell script
    dscl . create '/Users/tommy' UniqueID 502
    ```

    ```shell script
    sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow Hide500Users -bool YES
    ```

* Make the user `tommy` a hidden user

  ```shell script
  # Enabling hidden status
  sudo dscl . create '/Users/tommy' IsHidden 1

  # Disabling hidden status
  sudo dscl . create '/Users/tommy' IsHidden 0
  ```

* Disable the `Other...` user from appearing in the login screen

    dscl . search /Groups GroupMembership 'root'
    ```

* Get the name os all of the groups

    ```shell script
    dscl . ls /Groups
    ```

* Check if the user `tommy` is a member of the group `admin`

    ```shell script
    dseditgroup -o checkmember -m 'tommy' 'admin'
    ```

* Add the user `tommy` to the group `admin`

    sudo dscl . change /Users/austin RealName 'Austin Traver' 'Fake Name'
    # confirming the change
    finger austin
    # reverting the chang
    sudo dscl . -change /Users/austin RealName 'Fake Name' 'Austin Traver'
    sudo dscl . -change /Users/austin RealName 'Fake Name' 'Austin Traver'
    ```


{{% aside info %}}

**Tip:** This is the command that is equivalent to checking the box "Allow user to administer this computer" on the Users & Groups page

{{% /aside %}}

* Remove `tommy` from the list of users who are members of the `admin` group

    ```shell script
    dseditgroup -o edit -d 'tommy' -t user 'admin'
    ```

{{% aside info %}}

**Update:** Apparently DSCL is no longer the recommended way to create users, and instead one should use the `sysadminctl` command instead. A tutorial has been included below.

{{% /aside %}}

## `sysadminctl`

* Create a user `tommy` whose password is `fighton`

    ```shell script
    # Use the user 'billy' and his password 'gobruins' to escalate privileges
    sysadminctl -adminUser 'billy' -adminPassword 'gobruins' \
      -addUser 'tommy' \
      -password 'fighton' \
      -fullName 'Tommy Trojan' \
      -UID 502 \
      -shell /bin/zsh \
      -home /Users/tommy
    ```

    ```shell script
    # Create the home directory for 'tommy'
    sudo createhomedir -c
    ```

* Add a user's password to those capable of unlocking the FileVault at boot

    ```shell script
    # Use the existing admin account 'billy' whose password is 'gobruins'
    # to allow the new admin account 'tommy' to login with the 'fighton' password
    sysadminctl -adminUser 'billy' -adminPassword 'gobruins' -secureTokenOn 'tommy' -password 'fighton'
    ```

## `fdesetup`

* Restart the computer, but bypass FileVault

    ```shell script
    sudo fdesetup authrestart
    ```


## Single User Mode

* Reboot the computer into single user mode

    ```shell script
    sudo launchctl reboot -s system
    ```

## Power Sound

* Play the audio file that stores the "device is charging" chime.

    ```shell script
    afplay /System/Library/CoreServices/PowerChime.app/Contents/Resources/connect_power.aif
    ```

## System Integrity Protection

If you need to make changes to the file system, it might require disabling system integrity protection. By default, the following directories are protected:

1. `/System`
2. `/usr`
3. `/bin`
4. `/sbin`
5. `/var`

There are three directories that are not protected:

1. `/Applications`
2. `/Library`
3. `/usr/local`

* Disabling system integrity protection

    ```shell script
    csrutil disable
    ```

* Enabling system integrity protection

    ```shell script
    csrutil enable
    ```

* Checking system integrity protection

    ```shell script
    csrutil status
    ```

## Configuring the Login Page

* Show additional info by clicking the clock in the top-right corner

    ```shell script
    sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow AdminHostInfo IPAddress
    ```

* Adding a welcome message to the login page

  ```shell script
  # [ Adding the message ]
  sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow LoginwindowText -string 'Welcome back'

  # [ Removing the message ]
  sudo defaults delete /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow LoginwindowText
  ```

* Adding a script to run at login

    ```shell script
    sudo defaults write com.apple.loginwindow LoginHook /path/to/script
    ```

{{% aside warning %}}

**Note:** It's preferrable to have these processes launch as LaunchAgents, but LoginHooks still work in the latest version of macOS.

{{% /aside %}}

* Adding a graphic+text banner to appear upon login

    ```shell script
    sudo cp ./banner /Library/Security/PolicyBanner
    ```

* Disable buttons on the login page

    ```shell script
    sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow ShutDownDisabled -bool true
    sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow RestartDisabled -bool true
    sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow SleepDisabled -bool true
    sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow SleepDisabled -bool true
    ```

* Reenable buttons on the login page

    ```shell script
    sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow ShutDownDisabled -bool false
    sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow RestartDisabled -bool false
    sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow SleepDisabled -bool false
    sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow SleepDisabled -bool false
    ```

* Disable the user icons from the login page (this sets the "username & password" format as the default for the login page)

    ```shell script
    sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow SHOWFULLNAME -bool true
    ```

{{% aside success %}}

**Tip:** You can also just press `option-return` to toggle this view-mode if you'd rather not enable it by default

## `diskutil`

Something learned from `man hdiutil`:
  `/dev/rdisk` nodes are character-special devices, but are "raw" in the BSD sense and force block-aligned I/O. They are closer to the physical disk than the buffer cache. `/dev/disk` nodes, on the other hand, are buffered block-special devices and are used primarily by the kernel's filesystem code. In layman's terms `/dev/rdisk` goes almost directly to disk and `/dev/disk` goes via a longer more expensive route

* View available storage devices

    ```shell script
    diskutil list
    ```

* Erase a hard drive's partitions

    ```shell script
    sudo diskutil partitionDisk /dev/disk2 1 MBR "Free Space" "%noformat%" 100%
    ```

* Copy image to a new hard drive

    ```shell script
    diskutil unmount /dev/disk2s1
    sudo dd bs=1M if='/path/to/file.img' of='/dev/rdisk2' conv=sync
    sudo dd bs=1M if='/path/to/file.img' of='/dev/rdisk2' conv=sync
    ```

* Copy the current hard drive into an image

  ```shell script
  # Exporting an SD card save
  sudo dd bs=4M if=/dev/sdb of=raspbian.img

  # Importing an SD card save
  sudo dd bs=4M if=raspbian.img of=/dev/sdb
  ```

* Eject a device

    ```shell script
    sudo diskutil eject /dev/rdisk2
    ```

* Enable vpn connection on port 3340

    ```shell script
    kill $(lsof -ti :3340) &> /dev/null
    ssh -fNCD 3340 'ssh://bastion@52.52.124.230:22'
    networksetup -setsocksfirewallproxystate Wi-Fi on
    return 0
    return 0
    ```

* Disable vpn connection on port 3340

    ```shell script
    kill $(lsof -ti :3340) &> /dev/null
    networksetup -setsocksfirewallproxystate Wi-Fi off
    return 0
    ```

## macOS Books

New to macOS Catalina is the Books application, which provides a cleaner interface for handling audiobooks on your Mac.

* The Books app stores audiobook files in `~/Library/Containers/com.apple.BKAgentService/Data/Documents/iBooks/Books/Audiobooks`

* Keep Books in a more convenient folder:

    ```shell script
    ln -s ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.BKAgentService/Data/Documents/iBooks/Books ~/Books
    ```

## macOS Notes

* Notes are stored in a sqlite database, located on your computer at `~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Notes/Data/Library/Notes/`

## Printing

* Scan for printers on the network that support the `IPP` protocol

    ```shell script
    dns-sd -Z _ipp._tcp .
    ```

* Scan for hosts on the network that have enabled login via the `SSH` protocol.

    ```shell script
    dns-sd -Z _ssh._tcp .
    ```

* Ping the printer to see if it responds

    ```shell script
    ping BRN3C2AF4C9463F.local
    ```

* Setup the printer, giving it the name `Brother`

    ```shell script
    # `-p 'Brother'`: Name the printer "Brother"
    # `-E`: Use TLS encryption when communicating across the network
    # `-v 'ipp://brother.local'`: Print to the URI `<ipp://brother.local>`
    # `-m 'everywhere'`: Use the IPP protocol
    lpadmin -p 'Brother' -E -v 'ipp://brother.local' -m 'everywhere'
    ```


* Make this printer the default

    ```shell script
    lpoptions -E -d 'Brother' -o sides=two-sided-long-edge
    # Creates ~/.cups/lpoptions with one line: "Default Brother sides=two-sided-long-edge"
    ```

  * `-p 'Brother'`: Name the printer "Brother"
  * `-E`: Use TLS encryption when communicating across the network
  * `-d`: Make this the default printer
  * `-o`: Set the option `sides` to `two-sided-long-edge`

* Print a file

    ```shell script
    lp ~/path/to/file.pdf
    ```

* Check the current printer configurations

    ```shell script
    lpstat -v
    ```

### Virtual Network Computing VNC

Virtual Network Computing, or *VNC*, is more commonly known as *Screen Sharing*, as this is the name of the application used for VNC on macOS. Your computer listens for VNC connections on port 5900, and you can use the `<vnc://user@host.net>` syntax to reach a particular user at a particular address.

* Launching a Screen Share from the terminal:

    ```shell script
    open vnc://tommy@trojan.net
    ```

* Enabling **Screen Sharing** from the terminal:

    ```shell script
    sudo defaults write /var/db/launchd.db/com.apple.launchd/overrides.plist com.apple.screensharing -dict Disabled -bool false
    ```

* Disabling **Screen Sharing** from the terminal:

    ```shell script
    sudo defaults write /var/db/launchd.db/com.apple.launchd/overrides.plist com.apple.screensharing -dict Disabled -bool true
    ```

### Icons

You can find icons in some of the following locations:

```txt
/System/Library/CoreServices/CoreTypes.bundle/Contents/Resources/
```

{{% aside info %}}

**Update:** macOS Big Sur doesn't seem to pull icons from this directory anymore.

{{% /aside %}}

You can also find some of the iOS icons in the following places

```txt
/System/Library/Extensions/IOSCSIArchitectureModelFamily.kext/Contents/Resources/
/System/Library/Extensions/IOStorageFamily.kext/Contents/Resources/
```

* Listing all icon files

    ```shell script
    print -l /System/Library/**/*/Contents/Resources/*.icns
    ```

I've made a script that can convert an image into an icon

* Convert PNG file `pic.png` into ICNS file `pic.icns`

    ```shell script
    iconset=${1%%.*}.iconset
    mkdir -v ${iconset}
    for ((s=16; s<=512; s*=2)); do
        sips -z ${s} ${s} ${1} -o ${iconset}/icon_${s}x${s}.png
    done
    for ((s=16; s<=256; s*=2)); do
        sips -z ${s} ${s} ${1} -o ${iconset}/icon_${s}x${s}@2x.png
    done
    cp ${1} ${iconset}/icon_512x512@2x.png
    iconutil -c icns ${iconset}
    rm -R ${iconset}
    ```

{{% aside danger %}}

**Warning:** This script was supposed to work, but it doesn't. To set an icon from a PNG file, open the PNG file in Preview, ⌘ C, open up Finder, select the folder/file to assign an icon to, ⌘ I, click on the icon atop the info panel, and ⌘ V the PNG file

{{% /aside %}}

## Filetype Conversion for Printing

* Convert a text file to PostScript

    ```shell script
    cupsfilter -m 'application/postscript' file.txt > file.ps
    ```

* Convert a text file to PDF

    ```shell script
    cupsfilter -m 'application/pdf' file.txt > file.pdf
    ```

## Defaults

`defaults` is a powerful command. `defaults` a tool to utilize when exporting and importing settings across machines

* Display file extensions

    ```shell script
    defaults write NSGlobalDomain AppleShowAllExtensions -bool true
    killall Finder
    ```

* Prevent file icons from displaying on the Desktop

    ```shell script
    defaults write com.apple.finder CreateDesktop -bool FALSE
    killall Finder
    ```

* Enable quit button for Finder application

    ```shell script
    defaults write com.apple.finder QuitMenuItem -bool true
    killall Finder
    ```

You can prohibit the modification of Finder preferences by selecting `Preferences...` in the menu bar. As to why you'd want to do this, I have no idea, but here you go:

{{% aside success %}}

**Tip:** You can replace `NSGlobalDomain` with the `-g` flag to specify that the `defaults` command is global in scope.

{{% /aside %}}

* Disabling key repeat

    ```shell script
    defaults write -g InitialKeyRepeat -int 10
    ```

* Resetting key repeat to default settings

    ```shell script
    defaults write -g InitialKeyRepeat -int 15 # 225 ms
    defaults write -g KeyRepeat -int 2 # 30 ms
    ```

* Disable modification of Finder preferences

    ```shell script
    defaults write com.apple.finder ProhibitFinderPreferences -bool true
    killall Finder
    ```

Similarly, you could prohibit the `Go to folder` action in Finder as well, for whatever reason

* Disable `Go to folder` action in the menu bar:

    ```shell script
    defaults write com.apple.finder ProhibitGoToFolder -bool true
    killall Finder
    ```

If you're tired of `.DS_Store` files popping up in all of your directories, there's a command to disable them entirely. Before you do however, it's worth nothing that the `.DS_Store` file is one that contains useful metadata about your file system browsing preferences, such as "Whether to open a folder in 'Application View' or in 'List View'"

* Disable creation of `.DS_Store` files

    ```shell script
    defaults write com.apple.desktopservices DSDontWriteNetworkStores -bool true
    ```

* Delete dock hiding delay

    ```shell script
    defaults write com.apple.dock autohide-delay -float 0
    killall Dock
    killall Dock
    ```

* Change minimum file size threshold for Mail Drop for macOS Mail

    ```shell script
    # 1024 = 1MB
    defaults write com.apple.mail minSizeKB 1024
    defaults write com.apple.mail minSizeKB 1024
    ```

* Hide the preview of images attached to a message in Mail

    ```shell script
    defaults write com.apple.mail DisableInlineAttachmentViewing -bool true
    ```

### TextEdit

* Use plain text as the default in TextEdit instead of rich text

    ```shell script
    defaults write com.apple.TextEdit RichText -int 0
    ```


### Misc

* Reset the DNS cache

    ```shell script
    sudo discoveryutil udnsflushcaches
    ```

* Change the cursor's blink rate

    ```shell script
    # Enter time in milliseconds
    defaults write -g NSTextInsertionPointBlinkPeriodOn -float 200
    ```

* Disable the full screen animation

    ```shell script
    # Disable slow animation
    defaults write -g NSWindowResizeTime -float 0.001
    ```

* Disable filenames from including date on screenshots

    ```shell script
    defaults write com.apple.screencapture 'include-date' -bool false
    killall SystemUIServer
    ```

* Disable power button sleeping the system

    ```shell script
    defaults write com.apple.loginwindow PowerButtonSleepsSystem -bool false
    ```

* Treat the help window (the one that shows user manuals) as a normal window [link to source](https://osxdaily.com/2012/12/13/stop-the-help-viewer-window-from-hovering-over-everything-else-in-mac-os-x/)

    ```shell script
    defaults write com.apple.helpviewer DevMode -bool true
    ```

* Change the format of the clock in the menu bar (A great tutorial on
  [setting the date and time format](https://www.tech-otaku.com/mac/setting-the-date-and-time-format-for-the-macos-menu-bar-clock-using-terminal/))

    ```shell script
    defaults write com.apple.menuextra.clock DateFormat 'EEE dd MMM h:mm:ss a'
    ```

## QuickLook 

### Extending QuickLook Previews 

* Adding previews for markdown files

    ```shell script
    brew cask install qlmarkdown
    xattr -cr ~/Library/QuickLook/QLMarkdown.qlgenerator
    qlmanage -r
    qlmanage -r cache
    killall Finder
    ```

* Adding syntax highlighting to code previews

#### Searching for messages in Mail { #search-mail }

Spotlight by default searches through mail as well, so to find a message, you can retrieve it from Spotlight, without even opening the Mail application.

To learn more about searching the Mail app

The Apple support article that covers how to [search for emails in Mail on Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/mail/mlhlp1003) is not sufficiently comprehensive in my opinion, so I've added more concrete instances of valid search operators in the examples found below.

* Search for all mail sent `to:` "Tommy Trojan"

    ```txt
    to:"Tommy Trojan"
    to:ttrojan@usc.edu
    ```

* Search for all mail received from "Billy Bruin"

    ```txt
    from:"Billy Bruin"
    from:bbruin@ucla.edu
    ```

* Search for all mail with `subject:` "Secret Recipe"

    ```txt
    subject:"Secret Recipe"
    ```

* Search for all mail whose subject contains both `secret` and `recipe`

    ```txt
    subject:secret subject:recipe
    ```

* Search for all mail from `2018` and earlier

    * With calendar format set to `ISO 8601`

    ```txt
    date:2018-12-31
    ```

* Search for mail between `2017` and `2019` (note the range is **not** inclusive)

    ```txt
    date:2017-2020
    ```

Type to:recipient@example.com to find all sent mail addressed to a specific recipient at a specific domain.
The subject search operator limits the search results to the contents of email subject lines.

Type subject:cookie in the search field to return all emails with the word "cookie" in the subject line.
Type subject:"cookie recipe" to find all mail with the phrase "cookie recipe" in the subject line.
Type subject:cookie subject:recipe to find all mail with both "cookie" and "recipe" in any order in the subject line.

#### Spotlight Siri Knowledge

Siri uses natural language processing (NLP) to identify good matches for searches that don't use search operators. Some useful examples are included below:

* Get the score of the Sharks vs Ducks game

    ```txt
    sharks vs ducks
    sharks game
    sharks game
    ```

* View the wikipedia entries matched by `Grease`

    ```txt
    wiki Grease
    ```

* View the score of the Yankees game

    ```txt
    score Yankees
    ```

* View the schedule of the Yankees

    ```txt
    schedule Yankees
    ```

* View the schedule of the Giants (Football) team

    ```txt
    Giants football schedule
    ```

* View the conversion rate of `USD to RMB`

    ```txt
    1 USD in RMB
    ```

* Convert temperature from 58 degrees Fahrenheit to Celsius

    ```txt

## Screen Capture

I recommend reading Apple's article [Take a screenshot on your Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201361). I learned something I didn't know. You can hold the ⌥ modifier key while taking a screenshot of a window to prevent the drop shadow from appearing!

Personally, I think the drop shadow is a good touch. If, however, you prefer that drop shadows be disabled by default when taking a screen capture of an application window, you can use the following command.

* Disable drop shadow for application window screenshots:

    ```shell script
    defaults write com.apple.screencapture disable-shadow -bool true && killall SystemUIServer
    ```

## FaceTime

When you're on a FaceTime audio call, or any phone call for that matter, your desktop will be presented with a small window in the top-right corner. That window can be bothersome, as it floats on top of of whatever applications you're using. I discovered how it can be hidden:

* Hide the FaceTime window

    ```shell script
    pkill -9 FaceTimeNotificationService
    ```

## AirDrop

You can [add AirDrop to the dock](https://osxdaily.com/2018/01/15/add-airdrop-to-mac-dock/) by visiting the following directory.

```txt
/System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app/Contents/Applications
```

From there, click and drag the `AirDrop.app` icon to your dock

You can also drag the `iCloud.app` icon to your dock as well.

## Launchpad

You can change the Launchpad icon grid layout, but it requires some `defaults write` commands, provided below.

* Set the number of rows in Launchpad

    ```shell script
    # Default: 5 rows 
    defaults write com.apple.dock springboard-rows -int 5
    killall Dock
    ```

* Set the number of columns in Launchpad

    ```shell script
    # Default 7 columns
    defaults write com.apple.dock springboard-columns -int 7
    killall Dock
    ```

* Restore the default Launchpad app layout

    ```shell script
    defaults write com.apple.dock ResetLaunchPad -bool true
    killall Dock
    ```

* Restore the Launchpad dimensions to its original 5x7 layout

    ```shell script
    defaults delete com.apple.dock springboard-rows
    defaults delete com.apple.dock springboard-columns
    killall Dock
    ```

## `sips`

Mac has an inbuild tool for editing images called `sips`, which is an
abbreviation for *scriptable image processing system*. You can learn about it
here, but I encourage you to check out `man sips` and `sips --help` as well.

{{% aside warning %}}

**Note:** By default, `sips` modifies the images in-place. To save the output of
the command as a separate image, use the `-o {{< var OUTPUT_FILE >}}` option.

* Convert PNG file to JPEG format

    ```shell script
    # Valid formats are as follows:
    # jpeg | tiff | png | gif | jp2 |
    # pict | bmp | qtif | psd | sgi | tga
    sips -s format jpeg './image.png' -o './image.jpeg'
    ```

* Rotate PNG file 90 degrees

    ```shell script
    sips -r 90 'image.png'
    ```

* Flip an image horizontally

    ```shell script
    sips -f horizontal 'image.png'
    ```

* Flip an image vertically

    ```shell script
    sips -f vertical 'image.png'
    ```

* Crop an image to {{< var HEIGHT >}} by {{< var WIDTH >}}

    ```shell script
    sips -c {{< var HEIGHT >}} {{< var WIDTH >}} 'image.png'
    ```

* Resize image to updated dimensions {{< var HEIGHT >}} by {{< var WIDTH >}}.
  (**Note:** this may alter the actual aspect ratio)

    ```shell script
    sips -z {{< var HEIGHT >}} {{< var WIDTH >}} 'image.png'
    ```

* Resize image to a maximum height **or** width {{< var DIMENSION >}},
  preserving the existing aspect ratio

    ```shell script
    sips -Z {{< var DIMENSION >}} 'image.png'
    ```

* Get the dimensions (width and height) of an image

    ```shell script
    sips -g pixelWidth -g pixelHeight {{< var IMAGE >}}
    ```

## Daemons, Agents, and Automation

[daemon][Wikipedia daemon]
   : A computer program that runs as a background process.

[agent][Wikipedia software agent]
   : A program that acts on behalf of another program, or on behalf of another
   user.

[user agent][Wikipedia user agent]
   : a daemon specific to a logged-in user that only executes while that user
   is logged in.

[process identifier][Wikipedia process identifier]
   : a number used by most [operating system][] [kernels][Wikipedia kernel] to
   uniquely identify an active [process][Wikipedia process].

[Wikipedia kernel]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system) 'Kernel (operating system)'
[process]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_(computing) 'Process (computing)'
[operating system]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system 'Operating system'

The original daemon is `init`, which has [process identifier][Wikipedia process identifier] #1 because it is the first process
started during the booting of the computer system.

[Wikipedia process]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_(computing)
[Wikipedia process identifier]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_identifier

[Wikipedia user agent]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent
[Wikipedia software agent]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_agent

macOS has a more robust alternative to `cron` which allows daemon processes to
be triggered on a systematic fashion. Using the `launchctl` (launch control)
command, you can create daemon processes that will automatically run by the
system.

These files take the form of plist files and are found in several system
directories:

* /Library/LaunchAgents
* /Library/LaunchDaemons
* /System/Library/LaunchAgents
* /System/Library/LaunchDaemons
* ${HOME}/Library/LaunchAgents

If you write or install personal plist files, they will ideally go in the home
directory. A good example file to begin understanding the syntax can be located
in `/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist`, which is the file used to launch
the `ssh` daemon server that listens for incoming `ssh` connections.

Specifying privacy-sensitive files and folders in a launchd property list might
not work as expected and prevent the service from running. Having `Program` or
`Program Arguments` pointing to an executable in a privacy sensitive location is
currently allowed, but may be restricted in a future release.

To comply with the new privacy protections, resources for a launchd service must
be stored in locations that aren't privacy sensitive. If necessary, the app can
set up resources during its execution rather than using launchd property list
keys, making it possible to grant the app access using System Preferences >
Security & Privacy > Privacy. The following launchd property list keys are
affected: `Keep Alive`, `Path State`, `Queue Directories`, `Sockets`, `Sock Path
Name`, `Standard Error``Path`, `Standard In Path`, `Standard Out Path`, and
`Watch Paths`.


If you're setting up processes in `/Library/LaunchDaemons`, which are run as the
`root` user, then make sure to set the file permissions appropriately using
`chown root:wheel <file>` and `chmod 644 <file>`

* View `launchctl` information about a daemon process by its `PID`:

    ```shell script
    sudo launchctl profinfo <PID>
    ```

* View information about all services pertaining to a user's `UID`:

    ```shell script
    launchctl print user/$UID
    ```

* View information about a particular *running* service under a user's `UID`:

    ```shell script
    # ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.tommy.foo.plist
    launchctl print com.tommy.foo
    ```

* For all daemon processes owned by the current user, print `true` if they are disabled

    ```shell script
    launchctl print-disabled user/$UID
    ```

{{% aside warning %}}

**Note:** `launchtl` keeps an un-erasable record of disabled/enabled launch
daemons. If you make a typo when adding daemon, and disable it, *there is no way
to erase the entry.*

{{% /aside %}}

* Enable a daemon service

    ```shell script
    launchctl enable user/$UID/com.tommy.foo
    ```

* Disable a daemon service

    ```shell script
    launchctl disable user/$UID/com.tommy.foo
    ```

* Launch a daemon service

    ```shell script
    launchctl kickstart
    ```

* Launch any executable file with arguments as a launchctl

    ```shell script
    launchctl submit -l -- /path/to/executable 'arg1' 'arg2' 'arg3'
    ```
