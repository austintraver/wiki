  <summary>Welcome to my notebook</summary>
  <p>
    When I first arrived at college, I didn't know how to program. I had never
    written a single line of code. During my first semester, I enrolled in a
    course titled <em>Introduction to Programming</em>. On the first day of
    class, I arrived at the lecture hall, and was surprised to see how crowded
    and packed the room was. I made my way to the only remaining seat in the
    entire auditorium, and introduced myself to the group of sitting around to
    me.
  </p>
  <p>
    <q>Have any of you programmed before this class?</q> I inquired. Each of
    them nodded their head in affirmation. As it turns out, I was the only one
    among them who had never written a program before. I was in disbelief.
  </p>
  <p>
    <q>Wait, I don't understand. This class is titled <em>Introduction to
      Programming</em>. Why are you all even taking this class?</q> I inquired.
    <q>It sounds to me like each and every one of you already received your <em>Introduction
      to Programming</em>somewhere
    else beforehand...</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    <q>Yeah... the name of the class is a bit misleading</q>sympathized another
    student, <q>Usually students get their true introduction to programming in a
    different class: <em>Fundamentals of Computation</em>. If coding is
    new to you, I recommend you first take that class instead.</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    I didn't enter USC as a computer science major. If I had, then maybe I might
    not have foolishly registered for the wrong computer science class. On my
    first day, I wouldn't have walked into<em>Introduction to Programming</em>.
    Instead, I would have walked into <em>Fundamentals of Computation</em> and
    avoided this whole mess in the first place, yet lo and behold, there I was:
    sitting in class full of students who, as it turns out, are not actually
    beginners at all.
  </p>
  <p>
    I opened my laptop and navigated to USC's course registration page. I hunted
    for the course I'd just been recommended to switch into. When I went to
    confirm the change in registration, the request was denie. An error message
    popped up on my screen.
  </p>
  <p>
    To my dismay, I found that every section of the course had already filled
    up. It was too late, there was no room left for another student. I'd just
    have to take this class instead. My shoulders sank into my chair, defeated.
    I was out of luck.
  </p>
  <p>
    <q>What am I getting myself into?</q> I worried as I sat there, looking
    around the room, feeling a looming sense of dread. I closed my eyes, took a
    deep breath, and looked back up. The professor has just arrived. He made his
    way to the center of the room, and turned on the projector. The booming roar
    of the crowd fell to a hush murmur.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our first assignment, we were instructed, was to write a program in C, a
    language that many consider a bit hostile as an introductory language,
    especially for a beginner who had never programmed. For better or worse, at
    the time I had nothing to compare it to. That evening, I made my way
    across campus, entered the library, opened up my laptop, and set off to
    tackle this assignment. I read through the instructions: First, we needed a
    terminal. I found the Terminal application, and clicked the icon on my
    screen. A console window popped up. I froze: I had never used a command line
    interface before. I didn't know where to go from here. I just sat there.
    With every passing second, feelings of fear, shame, and incompetence
    festered inside me. The cursor on the console blinked back at me, almost
    mockingly. Panic began setting in. I was in way over my head.
  </p>
  <p>
    The student sitting next to me tapped my shoulder, and introduced himself.
    He was a senior, who came to the library to work on his capstone assignment,
    which, as luck would turn out, was for his degree in computer science! He
    smiled, glanced at my laptop, the empty terminal, the blinking cursor, and
    looked back to me. With one eyebrow raised, he ventured a guess:
  </p>
  <p>
    <q>You've never done this before, have you?</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    I had absolutely no idea what I was doing, this much must have been clear to
    him. It's probably why he introduced himself in the first place.
  </p>
  <p>
    <q>Yeah, not a clue... first time...</q> I sighed, and looked down,
    sheepishly. <q>Thanks for stepping in.</q> I added.
  </p>
  <p>
    <q>No worries, I remember writing this program. Here, I'll coach you through
      it.</q> he assured me.
  </p>
  <p>
    My eyes lit up. I thought it was too good to be true, but sure enough, he
    sat there with me, and guided me through each step of the assignment. We
    were about to reach the finish line. I held my breath as I typed one last
    arcane incantation into the terminal before me. I pressed <kbd>return</kbd>.
    Two words appeared on the screen: <samp> hello world </samp>
  </p>
  <p>
    Replaying the process in my head, I struggled to recall everything we'd
    done. I wasn't sure I'd be able to replicate this procedure. Sure, there was
    programming, but we also had to compile the program, and execute it as well.
    It felt so daunting. I turned to him, and sighed.
  </p>
  <p>
    <q>Do they really expect me to remember all of this? It's so many
      steps...</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    He laughed, he definitely had an answer he was ready to give, but he stopped
    himself. He paused, he looked back down at the laptop, and thought about it
    for a moment.
  </p>
  <p>
    <q>I guess you don't really have to remember how to do it.</q> he said,
    shrugging his shoulders. <em><q>You just have to remember where you wrote it
    down.</q></em>
  </p>
  <p>
    That advice really stuck with me. With each passing semester, I held onto it
    as I climbed one rung higher on the ladder of computer science.
  </p>
  <p>
    A couple of years passed by, and I landed a job as an assistant to a
    professor teaching software development in the computer science department.
    If you had told me back then, when I was a freshman in that lecture hall,
    that in just two years time, I would be directing labs, helping write exams,
    and holding office hours for students in a world that was once so alien to
    me, I doubt I'd believe you. I don't think there was ever a time during the
    beginning where I felt I'd go far, especially in such little time.
  </p>
  <p>
    I never had a chance to thank that senior-year student for the wisdom he
    gave me in the library that day. Even now, I still advise my own students,
    <q>Just <em>remember where you wrote it down</em>.</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    This is where I wrote it down, and everything I've ever learned since.
    Welcome to my notebook.
