  <summary>Welcome to my notebook</summary>
  <p>
    When I first arrived at college, I didn't know how to program. I'd never
    written a single line of code. During my first semester, I enrolled in a
    course called "Introduction to Programming" I arrived at the lecture hall
    the first day of class, made my way to the only remaining seat in the
    entire auditorium. I introduced myself to the students sitting next to me,
    and asked them if they were beginners too. Their response surprised me.  As
    it turned out, I was the only one of us who had never written a program
    before. I was in disbelief.
  </p>

  <p>
     <q>This class is called 'Introduction to Programming'. Why are you
       guys even taking this class?</q> I inquired. <q> It sounds
       to me like you've already received an 'Introduction to Programming' somewhere
     else beforehand...</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q>Yeah it's definitely confusing...</q> sympathized another student, <q>Usually
      students are introduced to programming in a different class: "Fundamentals of Computation". If you're new at this, you should probably take it first.</q></p>

  <p>
    Now, I know for cetain this wasn't mentioned in my orientation, but then
    again, there was no reason for it to have been: I didn't enter USC as a
    computer science student. If I had, I might have registered for the
    right class, but here I am instead, sitting in a class full of students
    who, from the sound of it, aren't exactly beginners.  I opened my laptop
    and navigated to USC's course registration page. I hunted for the course
    I'd just been recommended to switch into. When I went to confirm the
    the change in registration, an error message popped up on my screen. The
    transfer didn't go through. 

  </p>
  <p>
  To my dismay, I found that every section 
    of the course had already filled up. It was too late, there was no room
    left for another student. I'd just have to take this class instead. My
    shoulders sank into my chair, defeated. I was out of luck.
    </p>
    <p>
  <q>What am I getting myself into?</q> I worried as I sat there, looking around
  the room, feeling a looming sense of dread. I closed my eyes, took a deep breath, 
  and looked back up. The professor has just arrived. He made his way to the center
  of the room, and turned on the projector. The booming roar of the crowd fell to a hush
  murmur.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our first assignment, we were instructed, was to write a program in C, a
    language that many consider a bit hostile as an introductory language,
    especially for a beginner who had never programmed. But, for better or
    worse, at the time I had nothing to compare to. That evening, I made my way
    across campus, entered the library, opened up my laptop, and and set off to
    tackle this assignment. I read through the the instructions: First, we
    needed a terminal so I went to open mine up. When it opened, however, I
    froze: I'd never used a command line interface before. As I sat there,
    staring at the cursor, it blinked back at me, almost mockingly. Panic began
    setting in. I was in way over my head.
  </p>

  <p>
    The student sitting next to me tapped my shoulder, and introduced himself. He
    was a senior, who came to the library to work on his capstone assignment,
    which, as luck would turn out, was for his degree in computer science!  He
    smiled, glanced at my laptop, the empty terminal, the blinking cursor, and
    looked back to me.  With one eyebrow raised, he ventured a guess:
  </p>

  <p>
    <q>You've never done this before, have you?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    I had absolutely no idea what I was doing, this much must have been clear
    to him.  It's probably why he introduced himself in the first place.
  </p>

  <p>
  <q>Yeah, not a clue... first time...</q> I sighed, and looked down,
  sheepishly. <q>Thanks for stepping in.</q> I added.
  </p>

  <p>
  <q>No worries, I remember writing this program. Here, I'll coach you through it.</q>
  he assured me.
  </p>

  <p>
    My eyes lit up. I thought it was too good to be true, but sure enough,
    he sat there with me, and guided me through each step of the assignment. 
    When we reached the finish line. I entered one last arcane incantation
    into the terminal before me, held my breath, and pressed <kbd>return</kbd>. 
  </p>

  <p>
  Two words appeared atop my cursor: <samp> hello world </samp>
  </p>

  <p>
    Replaying the process in my head, I struggled to recall everything we'd
    done. I wasn't sure I'd be able to replicate this procedure. Sure, there
    was programming, but we also had to compile the program, and execute it
    as well. It felt so daunting. I turned to him, and sighed.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q>Do they really expect me to remember all of this? It's so many steps...</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    He laughed, he definitely had an answer he was ready to give, but he
    stopped himself. He paused, he looked back down at the laptop, and thought
    about it for a moment.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q>I guess you don't really have to remember how to do it.</q> he said,
    shrugging his shoulders. <em><q>You just have to remember where you wrote it
    down.</q></em>
  </p>

  <p>
    That advice really stuck with me. With each passing semester, I held onto
    it as I climbed one rung higher on the ladder of computer science.  

  </p>

  <p>
    A couple years passed by, and I land a job in the computer science 
    department, assisting the professor teaching a course on software development. 
    If you'd told the college freshman sitting in the lecture hall that in just two
    years time, he'd never believe you.  And yet, there I was: directing labs, helping write exams, and holding office hours for students. I never really thought I'd make it that far,
    especially in so little time. 
  </p>

  <p>
  I never had a chance to thank that senior-year student for the wisdom he 
  gave me in the library that day. Even now, I still pass the advise on
  to my own students: <em>You just have to remember where you wrote it down.</em>
  </p>

  <p>
  This is where I wrote it down, and everything I've ever learned since.
  Welcome to my notebook.
