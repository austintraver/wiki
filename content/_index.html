  <summary>Welcome to my notebook</summary>
  <p>
    When I first arrived at college, I didn't know how to program. I'd never written
a single line of code. During my first semester, I enrolled in a course called
"Introduction to Programming" I arrived at the lecture hall the first day of
class, made my way to the only empty seat still remaining. I introduced myself
to the students sitting next to me, and asked them if they were beginners too.
It turns out I was the only one among them who hadn't already been introduced to
programming. I was in disbelief.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q>But this is 'Introduction to Programming'!</q> I began, <q>How come I'm the
  odd man out?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    <q>Yeah it's weird...</q> sympathized another student, <q>USC students are
  introduced to programming in a different class: 'Fundamentals of Computation. If
  you're new at this you should probably take it first.</q></p>

  <p>
    I opened my laptop and reached the registration page. To my dismay, I found that
  every section offering the course had already filled up. My shoulders sank into
  my chair defeated, "What am I getting myself into?" I thought to myself. The
  professor entered the lecture hall, turned on the projector, and the roar of a
  lecture hall filled with 200 students fell to hush murmur.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our first assignment was to write a program in C, a language that some may
  consider a bit hostile for beginners trying to write their first program. For
  better or worse though, I had nothing to compare it against. In the evening, I
  made my way to the library, opened up my laptop, and started walking through the
  instructions for our first assignment. When I opened up the terminal, I froze.
  I'd never used a command line interface. I sat there, staring at the cursor, as
  it blinked at me, almost mockingly. Panic began setting in. I was in way over my
  head.
  </p>

  <p>
    The student sitting next to me taps my shoulder, and introduces himself. It
  turns out he's finishing up his major in computer science, and came to the
  library to work on a programming assignment of his own. He smiled, glanced my
  laptop, saw the empty terminal, the blinking cursor, and turned to me.
  </p>

  <p>
    With one eyebrow raised, he ventured a guess:
  </p>

  <p>
    <q>You've never done this before, have you?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    It must have been clear to the guy that I had absolutely no idea what I was
  doing. I'm sure it was why introduced himself in the first place.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q>Yeah, first time..." I nodded, and looked down, sheepishly. "Thanks for
  stepping in.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
  <q>No worries, I remember writing this program, I'll coach you through it!</q>
  he assured me.
  </p>

  <p>
    I was unsure if he meant it, but step by step, he guided me across the
  assignment until we reached the finish line. I enter one last command into the
  terminal. The program starts up, and two words appear beside my cursor:
  </p>

  {{% samp %}}

  hello world

  {{% /samp %}}

  <p>
    Replaying the process in my head, it still felt so daunting. I turned to him,
  and sighed.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q>Do they expect me to remember how to do all of this? It's so many steps!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    He laughed, he definitely had an answer he was ready to give, but he
  stopped himself. He paused, he looked back down at the laptop, and thought about
  it for a moment.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q>You don't really have to remember how to do it.</q> he said, and shrugged his
    shoulders. <em><q>You just have to remember where you wrote it down.</q></em>
  </p>

  <p>
    I stuck with it, and with each passing semester, I climbed one rung higher on
  the ladder of computer science. A couple years into the major, I land a job
  assisting the professor teaching software development. He had me direct labs,
  facilitate projects, and hold office hours for his students. They'd come to
  office hours for help on their labs, projects, assignments. I never really
  thought the day would come, but here it is: it's my turn to be coach.
  </p>

  <p>
    I give them the same advice: <q><em>You just have to remember where you wrote it
  down.</em></q>
  </p>

  <p>
  This is where I wrote it down, and everything I've ever learned since.
