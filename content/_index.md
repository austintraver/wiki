# Welcome 👋🏻

## Check out my notebook! ⭐️{#my-notebook}

My years in college have resulted in quite a vast exploration. The articles below contains years of my notes, everything I've ever jotted down, dutifully maintained over the course of countless code-marathons. I built this website for a certain kind of [forgetful developer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/austintraver), the type that always forgets how to code write the solution, but always remembers where the solution was once written down.

So by all means, dive right in! Explore to your heart's content.
