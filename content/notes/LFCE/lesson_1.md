# Installing Linux

## Understanding Linux Distributions

* CentOS is a version of RedHat without RedHat's proprietary components
  * Thought of as the "Community Edition"

* Fedora is the development platform, the community operating system
  * Free product, funded by RedHat
  * RedHat uses Fedora's new features, tested by Fedora's users, adds it to RedHat Enterprise Linux, and then CentOS some time after that.


* Linux Mint is built off Ubuntu, which is built off Debian
  * RedHat uses RPM Packages
  * Ubuntu uses DPK

* SUSE and Oracle Enterprise Linux are other distros
