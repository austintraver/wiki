# Node.js

Node.js provides server-side functionality in familiar Javascript syntax and an asynchronous model.  To be clear, Node.js is not a programming language. It adds features to Javascript that allow developers to write server-side code in familiar front-end language.


## How It Works

As an interpreted language (like Python), Javascript requires a runtime engine to be run. How Node js functions as a server side language is its runtime engine allows it to interact with a server. In the browser, a Javascript engine provides access to Web Platform APIs and the window HTML (DOM). Node uses Google's V8 Javascript engine instead to access files, send data, and provide other server capabilities. The V8 engine powers Chrome, but there are other engines out there:

1. Firefox uses [SpiderMonkey](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/SpiderMonkey)
2. Safari uses [JavaScriptCore](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/javascriptcore)
3. IE uses [who on üåç cares](https://github.com/Microsoft/ChakraCore)

The Chrome V8 Javascript engine provides C++ bindings for Javascript. The V8 Engine then passes events and data between the server and client.

Let's take a small example. Javascript has no concept of accessing system files, but in Node.js, we gain this functionality through modules. We'll get to modules later, but here's a small example of what you can do with Node.js using the built in filesystem module `fs`.

* Create `helloworld.js`

  ```js
  // ./helloworld.js
  const fs = require('fs')
  const story = 'It was the best of JS, it was the worst of JS'
  fs.writeFileSync(
    './story.txt', 
    story
  )
  ```

  ```txt
  ./story.txt
  It was the best of JS, it was the worst of JS
  ```

Alternatively, you can run this in the `node` console. In your terminal, typing `node` creates a shell utilizing a *Read Evaluate Print Loop* (**REPL**)

What this means is that as expressions are evaluated, their return value is printed in the console. You can invoke the REPL by just typing `node` in your terminal. Then, you can test what expressions are doing. Which is useful for debugging expressions and playing around with Javascript.

  ```js
  /* Enter the number 4, then press enter */
  4 // <Enter>
  ++_ // Increment the previous expression by 1
  ```

{{% aside info %}}
**Warning:** In this example, we used `_` , which refers to the previous expression. However, this feature has been deprecated, and you'll get an annoying warning if you try to use it.
{{% /aside %}}

You'll notice that the return value is printed below each statement executed:

  ```js
  v = "Vim"
  // => 'Vim'
  e = "Emacs"
  // => 'Emacs'
  console.log("I'm a pro since I use ", v)
  // => I'm a pro since I use Vim
  ```


* Using the *dictionary* and *list* data structures:

  ```js
  listOfEditors = [v, e]
  // => [ 'Vim', 'Emacs' ]
  editors = {}
  // => {}
  editors[v] = "superior"
  // => 'superior'
  editors[e] = "inferior"
  // => 'inferior'
  editors
  // => { Vim: 'superior', Emacs: 'inferior }
  ```

You can exit the REPL by pressing `^D` or `^C^C`.

The `process` variable, only accessible to you in Node, not in the browser. `process` is a list of current tasks that Node is executing.

* Typing `process` in the REPL will print out all environment variables

* The `process.exit()` method is another way of exiting from the REPL, or from a program you've written.

## Module System

Modules in Nodejs are essentially Javascript libraries. There are quite a few built-in libraries available by default in Nodejs, including (thanks to [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/ref_modules.asp) for the rundown):

- `assert`	Provides a set of assertion tests
- `buffer`:	To handle binary data
- `child_process`:	To run a child process
- `cluster`:	To split a single Node process into multiple processes
- `crypto`:	To handle OpenSSL cryptographic functions
- `dgram`:	Provides implementation of UDP datagram sockets
- `dns`:	To do DNS lookups and name resolution functions
- `domain`:	Deprecated. To handle unhandled errors
- `events`:	To handle events
- `fs`:	To handle the file system
- `http`:	To make Node.js act as an HTTP server
- `https`:	To make Node.js act as an HTTPS server.
- `net`:	To create servers and clients
- `os`:	Provides information about the operation system
- `path`:	To handle file paths
- `punycode`:	Deprecated. A character encoding scheme
- `querystring`:	To handle URL query strings
- `readline`:	To handle readable streams one line at the time
- `stream`:	To handle streaming data
- `string_decoder`:	To decode buffer objects into strings
- `timers`:	To execute a function after a given number of milliseconds
- `tls`:	To implement TLS and SSL protocols
- `tty`:	Provides classes used by a text terminal
- `url`:	To parse URL strings
- `util`:	To access utility functions
- `v8`:	To access information about V8 (the JavaScript engine)
- `vm`:	To compile JavaScript code in a virtual machine
- `zlib`:	To compress or decompress files

### Importing Modules

* To import and use code you wrote in another file, use the `require()` function, passing in the parameter of the filepath

* Importing code from the file `hello.js`

  ```js
  const hello = require('./hello')
  ```

## The Core

Nodejs requires a few critical components that allow it to provide its functionality.  These objects are part of what separate Nodejs applications from vanilla Javascript code:

    1. Global Objects
    2. Timer Methods
    3. Sockets and Streams
    4. Utilities
    5. Events

### Global Objects

There are three primary global objects available in Nodejs. They are:

1. `global`
2. `process`
3. `Buffer`

Each of these objects are in a Node application's namespace, meaning a `require` statement is _not required_ (bad pun intended).

Variables and required objects are accessible within the application's namespace. This access is restricted to the variables within the application, meaning you are unable to change the value of variables in other other modules. This prevents accidental collisions when code from another module runs.

The process object provides access to the Node installation, the three methods of standard I/O (stdin, stderr, stdout), and application memory usage.

The Buffer object handles binary data. You can read any type of data through a buffer, including a file, input stream, or network connection. A Buffer object take up to two parameters:

### Timers

Timers in Nodejs allow programmers to delay and schedule execution of functions. The timer module includes the functions:

- `setTimeout `
- `clearTimeout `
- `setInterval `
- `clearInterval`

### Sockets and Streams

There are four major types of streamed connections in Nodejs:

1. TCP - `net` module
2. HTTP - `http` module
3. UDP/Datagram Socket - `dgram` module
4. Readline/Child_Process - `readline`, `child_process` modules

Using a TCP connection, we can recieve messages from client's standard input on the server program. The `process` is used directly here to access standard I/O streams.

* Example of a TCP Server:

  ```js
  const net = require('net')

  let listener = (connection) => {
    /* Print 'Connected' */
    console.log('Client has created a connection')
    /* Print when data is received from this connection */
    connection.on('data', (data) => {
      /* Print the data and its source */
      console.log(`data() called, received data from ${connection.remoteAddress}:${connection.remotePort}\n${data}`)
      /* Repeat the data sent back to the client */
      connection.write(`'server': ${data}`)
    })
    /* Print when the connection is closed by the client */
    connection.on('close', () => {
      console.log(`Client has closed the connection`)
    })
  }

  /* Create a server object, with a callback function for a connection */
  let server = new net.Server(listener)

  server.on('error', (error) => {
    if (error.code === 'EADDRINUSE') {
      console.error(`Error: Port ${error.port} already in use.`)
    }
    else {
      console.error(error)
    }
  })

  /* Set up a port number to be used by this server */
  const PORT = 1234

  /* Spin up the server, listening on port 1234 */
  server.listen(PORT)
  console.log(`Listening on port ${PORT}`)
  ```

* Example of a TCP Client:

  ```js
  const net = require('net')

  /* Create a client object with the corresponding listener */
  let client = new net.Socket()

  const HOST = '127.0.0.1'
  const PORT = 1234

  // Connect to the server
  client.connect(PORT, HOST, () => {
    console.log('Connected to server')
    // Send a message to the server
    client.write('This is a message')
  })

  // prepare for input from terminal
  process.stdin.resume()

  // When user inputs data on `stdin`, send data to server
  process.stdin.on('data', (data) => {
    client.write(data)
  })

  // When receive data back, print to console
  client.on('data', (data) => {
    console.log(`data() called, received data: ${data}`)
  })

  client.on('close', () => {
    console.log('close() called, connection to server has been closed')
  })

  /* Print when the connection is closed by the client */
  client.on('end', () => {
    console.log('end() called, server no longer receiving new connections')
  })
  ```

## Working with I/O

The `.pipe(<stream>)` is used to send the ouput of one stream to another.

* Sending the output of one process to another:

  ```js
  process.stdin.pipe(process.stdout)
  ```

### Reading streams with `readline`

The readline module allows the reading of standard I/O streams line by line during program execution. When the programmer is done reading a stream, they must be closed. The REPL is implemented by piping your terminal input `stdin`, executing Javascript commands and piping `stdout` back to your terminal.

### Using system streams with `child_process`

Using the `child_process` module, a Node application can make system calls and recieve input from standard I/O. We do this in Node by defining a child process and redirecting its input and output by defining functions for whenever specific input is recieved.

For example, let's take the command `ls`:

* Defining a function call

  ```js
  // format: `spawn("<name>" , [ "flag1", "flag2", ...])`
  const { spawn } = require('child_process')
  const ls = spawn('ls', ['-la'])
  ```

You can specify how the function interacts with I/O by using the `.on()` method

Specifying how `ls()` interacts with `stdin`, `stdout`, and `stderr`:

  ```js
  ls.stdout.on('data', (data) => {
    console.log(`The output of ls is ${data}`)
  })

  ls.stderr.on('data', (data) => {
    console.log(`ls exited with error ${data}`)
  })

  ls.on('close', (code) => {
    console.log(`child process exited with code ${code}`)
  }
  ```

The program below illustrates an elaborate way to execute the command: `ls | grep "fork"`

* Simulating the execution of the shell command `ls | grep "fork"`

  ```js
  const {spawn} = require('child_process')
  const ls = spawn('ls')
  const grep = spawn('grep', ['fork'])

  ls.stdout.on('data', (data) => {
    grep.stdin.write(data)
  })

  ls.stderr.on('data', (data) => {
    grep.stderr.write(`Error: ${data}`)
  })

  ls.on('close', (code) => {
    grep.stdin.end()
  })

  grep.stdout.on('data', (data) => {
    grep.stdout.write(data.toString())
  })
  ```

### Utilities

The utilities object enables inheritance in Node. An object can be inherited by another object using the `inherits` function:

`util.inherits(<source-object>, <target-object>)`

### Events & EventEmitter

As mentioned previously, event based programming is fundamental to the Node philosophy. The `events` module allows programmers to define actions for events much like `try/catch` blocks in Java and C++ or `try/except` blocks in Python. This method of programming puts the programmer in an event driven mindset to focus on all the events that a program must handle. Node modules are written to minimize the amount of boilerplate code written and shift focus to the actions.

Here are the steps to define an event:

1. require: `require('events')`
2. instantiate
3. define the **callback**
4. define the **event**

* Defining and triggering an event:

  ```js
  // import specific module function to use
  var eventEmitter = require('events').EventEmitter
  var counter = 0

  // create an event emitter object
  var em = new eventEmitter()

  // define a callback when the event 'timed' occurs
  em.on('timed', (data) => console.log('timed ' + data))

  // trigger the event for example
  setInterval( () => em.emit('timed', counter++), 3000)
  ```

# JavaScript

## Data Types

JavaScript has primitive data types, which are immutable

1. Number
2. String
3. Boolean
4. Null
5. Undefined
6. Symbol

JavaScript also has some built-in objects

1. Array
2. Date
3. RegExp
4. Map & WeakMap
5. Set & WeakSet

### Specifying Integer Type

* Specifying integers using different formats:

  ```js
  let val = 10
  let hex = 0x2f // (47)
  let exponential = 1.2e4 // (1.2 * 10^4)
  let max = Infinity
  let min = -Infinity
  ```

### Number Properties

* Specifying values using the properties of `Number`:

  ```js
  let maxValue = Number.MAX_VALUE
  let minValue = Number.MIN_VALUE

  let maxInt = Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER
  let minInt = Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER
  ```

## Special Characters

|Code|Description|
|:---:|:---:|
|`\n`|newline|
|`\r`|carriage return|
|`\t`|horizontal tab|
|`\'`|single quote|
|`\$`|dollar sign|
|`\\`|back-slash|
|`\b`|backspace|
|`\f`|form feed|
|`\v`|vertical tab|
|\&grave;|grave symbol|

### String Substitutions

* Using the backtick syntax to substitue a variable's value inside of a string.

  ```js
  const temp = 22.5
  console.log(`The value is ${temp}`)
  ```

### `null` and `undefined`

* A variable is `undefined` when it is initialized without being assigned a value.
* A variable is only `null` when it is assigned as such

## Objects

* Creating an object:

  ```js
  const person = {
    name: "Austin",
    age: 21
  }
  ```

## UTF-8

A variable can be defined using normal letters, as well as UTF-8 characters

* Creating a variable using UTF-8 characters

  ```js
  const ‰Ω†Â•Ω = "Hello"
  console.log(‰Ω†Â•Ω)
  // => "Hello"
  ```

## Arrow Functions

Arrow functions allow us to give a function an identifier.

```js
// Create a function 'squareIt' accepting an input 'x' and returning 'x' squared
const squareIt = (x) => x * x

// After 'squareIt' has been written, we can now call the identifier and give it input
squareIt(10) // '100'
```

## Equality '==' vs. '==='

* `===` is known as the *identity operator*
* `==` is known as the *equality operator*

The identity operator `===` will compare both types and values between two variables. JavaScript objects are compared by reference, not by value. An object is equal to itself, but not equal to a different object with the same value.

* Examples of the two operators being different:

  ```js
  true === '1' // false
  true == '1' // true

  true === 1 // false
  true == 1 // true

  null === undefined // false
  null == undefined // true
  ```

* Examples of the two operators being the same:

  ```js
  [1, 2] === [1, 2] // false
  [1, 2] == [1, 2] // false

  0 === 0.0 // true
  0 == 0.0 // true
  ```


There are also some edge cases worth noting:

* The equality operator `==` will attempt to convert the two variables

* Not a number or `NaN` is not equal in comparison to anything, even with itself

  ```js
  NaN === NaN // false
  NaN == NaN // false
  x = NaN
  x === NaN // false
  x !== x // true
  ```


## JavaScript Arrays

The [Mozilla Javascript Documentation for Arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array) will explain it better than I can.

## The "in" operator

The `in` operator evaluates to true if the left-side value is the name of a property of the right-side object. This results in some counterintuitive logic at times, an example is provided below:

```js
// Arrays
let trees = ['redwood', 'bay', 'cedar', 'oak', 'maple']
0 in trees        // returns true (array index 0 exists)
3 in trees        // returns true (array index 3 exists)
6 in trees        // returns false (array index 6 does not exist)
'bay' in trees    // returns false (you must specify the index number, not the value at that index)
'length' in trees // returns true (length is an Array property)
Symbol.iterator in trees // returns true (arrays are iterable, works only in ES2015+)

// Predefined objects
'PI' in Math          // returns true

// Custom objects
let mycar = {make: 'Honda', model: 'Accord', year: 1998}
'make' in mycar  // returns true
'model' in mycar // returns true
```

```js
const data = [7, 8, 9]
"0" in data // true: array has an element "0"
1 in data // true: numbers are converted into strings
7 in data // false: no 7th element in this array
```

## GitHub Package Registry

Add the following two lines to your `~/.npmrc`

```txt
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=${GITHUB_TOKEN}
registry = https://npm.pkg.github.com
```

Add the `read:packages` and `write:packages` permissions to your `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable in the [GitHub tokens page](https://github.com/settings/tokens)

### Install a Package

To add [this Package](https://github.com/Codertocat/hello-world-npm/packages/10696) registered on the GitHub NPM Registry, enter the following command

```sh
npm install @codertocat/hello-world-npm
```

Alternatively, you can add the package as a dependency to the project's `package.json`

```json
{
  "name": "testjs",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.js",
  "license": "MIT",
  "dependencies": {
    "@codertocat/hello-world-npm": "^1.0.2"
  }
}
```

### Publish a Package

Add the following to your package's `package.json`

```json
{
  "publishConfig": {
    "registry":"https://npm.pkg.github.com/"
  }
}
```

### Files

* Convert relative path `./file.txt` to absolute path `/Users/tommy/file.txt`

  ```js
  let absolute_filepath = path.resolve('./file.txt')
  console.log(absolute_filepath)
  ```

  ```txt
  /Users/tommy/file.txt
  ```

* Convert local file `./file.txt` to `file://` URI form:

  ```js
  let uri = url.pathToFileURL('./file.txt')
  console.log(uri)
  ```

  ```txt
  URL {
    href: 'file:///Users/austin/hooman/node.html',
    origin: 'null',
    protocol: 'file:',
    username: '',
    password: '',
    host: '',
    hostname: '',
    port: '',
    pathname: '/Users/austin/hooman/node.html',
    search: '',
    searchParams: URLSearchParams {},
    hash: ''
  }
  ```

## Express

* Example of an Express server

  ```js
  // Import the express library
  const express = require('express')

  // Construct a server object
  const server = express()

  // Save the port number as a variable
  const port = 1337

  // Support JSON in POST requests
  server.use(express.json())

  // Respond to GET requests to /ping with 'pong'
  server.get('/ping', (req, res) => {
      console.log(req.query)
      res.send('pong')
  })

  // Respond to GET requests to /dog with `dog` as JSON
  server.get('/dog', (req, res) => {
      let dog = {
          name: 'fido',
          age: 2
      }
      res.status(200).json(dog)
  })

  // Respond to POST requests to /whoami by printing the content
  server.post('/whomai', (req, res) => {
      console.log(req.body)
  })


  // Begin the server, listening on the port declared above
  server.listen(port, () => {
      console.log(`Example app listening on ${port}!`)
  })
  ```

## MongoDB

* Example of a MongoDB insertion

  ```js
  const username = 'db_user'
  const password = 'drop_it_like_its_hot'
  const cluster = 'cluster0-asdf.mongodb.net'
  const database = 'students'

  const uri = `mongodb+srv://${username}:${password}@${cluster}`

  // Import the MongoClient class from the 'mongodb' library
  const {MongoClient} = require('mongodb')

  // Construct an instance of a MongoDB Client
  const client = new MongoClient(uri)


  async function main() {
      try {
          // Establish a connection to the cloud-hosted database cluster
          await client.connect()
          // Use the database 'wiki' if it exists, and create it if it doesn't
          const db = client.db("wiki")
          //create user we will just want to pull the text they enter in text boxes
          let user = {
              username: "ttrojan",
              password: "fighton"
          }
          // Use the collection 'users' if it exists, and create it if it doesn't
          let collection = db.collection("users")

          // Insert 'user' into the collection 'users' in the database 'wiki'
          await collection.insertOne(user, (error, response) => {
              if (error) {
                throw error
              }
              console.log("User inserted:")
              console.log(user)
          })
      } catch (e) {
          // If there is an error in connection, print it
          console.error(e)
      } finally {
          // Close the connection to the client when the function ends
          await client.close()
      }
  }

  // Execute the main function, printing errors if they occur
  main().catch(console.error)
  ```
