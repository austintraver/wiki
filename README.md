# The Helpful Wiki

Welcome to the wiki, which doubles as my personal notebook for all things "software engineering."

This website is written in Go, Markdown, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS using 
the [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) development framework.

Visit <https://helpful.wiki> to view the website where builds are deployed to. You may just learn something new!

To help empower other developers to write their own documentation, tutorials, and how-to articles,
I created ["Doctober", a website theme for Hugo](https://github.com/austintraver/doctober).
If you're trying to build your own website, consider trying it out!
