# The Helpful Wiki

Welcome to the wiki, which doubles as my personal notebook for all things "software engineering."

This website is written in Go, Markdown, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS using 
the [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) development framework.

Visit <https://helpful.wiki> to view the website where builds are deployed to. You may just learn something new!

To help empower other developers to write their own documentation, tutorials, and how-to articles,
I created ["Doctober", a website theme for Hugo](https://github.com/austintraver/doctober).
If you're trying to build your own website, I strongly encourage you to check it out.

## Inspiration

When I was a freshman, I was struggling with a programming assignment.

The amount of code that's required to... "code", was overwhelming to 
me as a beginner programmer.

I asked a senior sitting next to me:

> How can I possibly be expected to remember all of this?

He advised me:

> You don't have to remember how you did it, you just have to remember where you wrote it down.

That advice really stuck with me. With each passing semester, I held onto
it as I climbed one rung higher on the ladder of computer science.  

I never had a chance to thank that senior-year student for the wisdom he 
passed on to me in the library that day. Even now, I still regularly share
the same advice when coaching new developers: sometimes learning a new skill
can be a lot less stressful if you document where you learned something, and
an example of code that *actually worked*, along the way. 

Whether its lines of code or lyrics in your favorite song, as soon as you can
recall the first couple of lines, your brain magically seems to remember the rest!

Everything I've ever learned that I had the foresight to write down, 
in hopes that one day, it will be something that I may need to remember.

Welcome to my notebook.
