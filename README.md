# The Helpful Wiki

Welcome to the wiki, which doubles as my personal notebook for all things "software engineering."

## Inspiration

When I was a freshman, I was struggling with a programming assignment.

The amount of code that's required to... "code", was overwhelming to 
me as a beginner programmer.

I asked a senior sitting next to me:

> How can I possibly be expected to remember [all of this boilerplate]?

He advised me:

> You don't have to remember how you did it, you just have to remember where you wrote it down.

That advice really stuck with me. With each passing semester, I held onto
it as I climbed one rung higher on the ladder of computer science.  

I never had a chance to thank that senior-year student for the wisdom he 
passed on to me in the library that day. Even now, I still regularly share
the same advice when coaching new developers: sometimes learning a new skill
can be a lot less stressful if you document where you learned something, and
an example of code that *actually worked*. From there, it's easy enough to jog
your memory.

As for myself, it's all here. Everything I've ever learned that I
had the foresight to write down, in hopes that one day, it will
be something that I may need to remember.

Welcome to my notebook.
